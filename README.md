# Web-App-AWS

A web application that randomly selects an entry from a database, shows it to the user, and allows the user to save contributions of their own, all from a single U.I.

[See the app on AWS](http://randomwisdom.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/) (This version runs on an AWS EC2 server, but can run on any server.)
